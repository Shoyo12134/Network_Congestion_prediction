# Network_Congestion_prediction
This project presents a machine learning-based approach for the prediction of network congestion in mobile networks. The objective is to develop a real-time, proactive model that can forecast congestion events before they occur, enabling network operators to take preventive measures and dynamically allocate resources to maintain service quality.
